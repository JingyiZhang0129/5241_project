# 5241_project

This notebook contians three parts, two parts of classification and one part is regression
1. Classfication for Predator common name:
 - select those mojar marine species
 - use predators features to predict their common name
2. Classfication for Prey taxon:
 - use prey features to predict their taxon
3. Regression:
 - use the features of predators to predict the length of prey
 (note: this part is not perform well so if you have other ideas please make some improvments about the regression part)
 
 For Data Cleaning (what we have already done)
 - unify the units of length and mass
 - drop missing values
 - seperate the dataframe of predators and prey
 - drop the unrelated columns and select some features for model
 
 what we need to do:
 1. draw some plots for data visualization and EDA part
 2. improve the regression 
 3. think about some clustering method
 4. evaluate model performance
 5. conclusion
